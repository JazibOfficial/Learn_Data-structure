## Application of array
Flickr sends information about photos as an ARRAY of JavaScript objects. You can go through that array to get a list of photos and display them on a page.

<p>You use arrays all of the time in programming. Whenever you need to keep track of an ordered list of items, you'll use an array: a list of songs, a list of each keystroke a user clicks. Even in the JSON data format, you'll often use an array to hold a list of objects.</p>
